# Learning Lab 🧪

> A collection of learning notes, experiments, and documented failures in tech

This repository is my public learning journal where I document everything from hardware troubleshooting to infrastructure setup. The goal is to learn in public and help others who might encounter similar challenges.

## 📖 What's Inside

### 💻 Programming
Language-specific notes, patterns, and learning materials
- **[Go/Golang](./programming/golang/)** - HTTP handling, context, error management, database patterns
- **[Python](./programming/python/)** - Modern backend development with FastAPI, async/await, SQLAlchemy

### 🚀 Projects
Hands-on implementations and code experiments
- **[Go Projects](./projects/go/)** - Concurrency examples, HTTP servers, Kafka demos
- **[Code Challenges](./projects/code-challenges/)** - Practice problems and solutions in Go and TypeScript

### 🏗️ Infrastructure  
Server setup, orchestration, and deployment guides
- **[VPS Setup](./infrastructure/vps/)** - First-time VPS configuration with security best practices
- **[Kubernetes](./infrastructure/k8s/)** - Container orchestration journey from local to production
- **[Docker](./infrastructure/docker/)** - Containerization basics and configurations
- **[Networking](./infrastructure/networking/)** - Network fundamentals and troubleshooting

### 📚 Topics
Cross-cutting technical concepts and best practices
- **[Security](./topics/security/)** - Hashing, encryption, and security patterns
- **[System Design](./topics/system-design/)** - Scalability and architecture principles
- **[Scalability](./topics/scalability/)** - Performance and scaling strategies
- **[JWT](./topics/jwt/)** - Authentication and authorization patterns
- **[Hosting](./topics/hosting/)** - Deployment workflows and domain management

### 🖥️ Hardware
- **[HHKB Professional Hybrid Type-S](./hardware/hhkb/)** - Battery logs, troubleshooting, and Steam Deck compatibility notes

## 💡 Philosophy

This is a "lab" for failures, mistakes, and broken things. I believe in:

- **Learning in public** - Sharing both successes and failures
- **Practical documentation** - Real-world solutions over theoretical knowledge  
- **Beginner-friendly explanations** - Breaking down complex topics
- **Process over perfection** - Documenting the journey, not just the destination
